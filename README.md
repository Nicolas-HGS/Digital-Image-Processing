<div style='text-align: justify;'>

This repository contains the codes made for the subject Introduction to Digital Image Processing to be taught at the Sergipe Federal University in its Electrical Engineering Department. One of the objectives of the codes is to provide mathematical understanding behind digital image processing techniquques. Visual Comparations are made in the biggest of the codes between the images generated by the developed codes and the images generated by using library functions and numerical comparations are made too (like square mean root) in some codes.
